Registration and Payment

As a condition to using Services, you will be required to register with Classcraft and select a Teacher User ID. You shall provide Classcraft with accurate, complete, and updated registration information. Failure to do so shall constitute a breach of this Agreement, which may result in immediate termination of your account.
You may not (i) select or use as a Teacher User ID a name of another person with the intent to impersonate that person; or (ii) use as a Teacher User ID a name subject to any rights of a person other than you without appropriate authorization.
Classcraft reserves the right to refuse registration of or cancel a Teacher User ID in its discretion. You shall be responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password.
Classcraft reserves the right to change its price list for certain Services and to institute new charges at any time, upon notice to you, which may be sent by email or posted on the Website. If you continue to use those Services following such notification, that use constitutes your acceptance of any new or increased charges.
You have chosen one of the following Payment Plans:

Annual: Pre-payment is made in advance for a full year. When making your initial payment, you authorize Classcraft to charge you an annual license fee at the then current rate to your Payment Method. You acknowledge that the amount billed each year may vary for reasons such as promotional offers, referral rewards and/or changing your Payment Plan and you authorize us to charge your Payment Method for such amounts, which may be billed in one or more charges. You will be notified by email before the expiration of your pre-payment so that you can cancel your subscription if you wish not to be billed for the next year.
Monthly: Prepayment is made in advance for one month. When making your initial payment, you authorize Classcraft to charge you a monthly license fee at the then current rate to your Payment Method. You acknowledge that the amount billed each month may vary from month to month for reasons such as promotional offers, referral rewards and/or changing your Payment Plan and you authorize us to charge your Payment Method for such amounts, which may be billed in one or more charges.
Paid by school or district: If your school or district has prepaid for your subscription, you will be presented with this as an option when you upgrade to Premium. In this instance, the payment, any renewals and the expiration of your subscription will be managed by your school or district.
Classcraft reserves the right to adjust pricing for our service or any components thereof at any time as may be determined in our sole and absolute discretion. You will be advised of any price changes in advance by email.

Classcraft will automatically bill your Payment Method each month on the calendar day corresponding to the commencement of your paying membership. Membership fees are fully earned upon payment. Classcraft reserves the right to change the timing of this billing, in particular, as indicated below, if your Payment Method has not successfully settled. In the event your paying membership began on a day not contained in a given month, Classcraft may bill your Payment Method on a day in the applicable month or such other day as we deem appropriate. For example, if you started your license on January 31st, your next payment date is likely to be February 28th, and your Payment Method would be billed on that date. Your billing date may change due to changes in your license.
PAYMENTS ARE NONREFUNDABLE AND THERE ARE NO REFUNDS OR CREDITS FOR PARTIALLY USED PERIODS. Following any cancellation, however, you will continue to have access to the services through the end of your prepayment period as identified in your Payment Plan. At any time, and for any reason, we may provide a refund, discount, or other consideration to some or all of our members ("credits"). The amount and form of such credits, and the decision to provide them, are at our sole and absolute discretion. The provision of credits in one instance does not entitle you to credits in the future for similar instances, nor does it obligate us to provide credits in the future, under any circumstance.
You may edit your Payment Method information by logging into the game and clicking on the "My Profile" link. If a payment is not successfully settled, due to expiration, insufficient funds, or otherwise, and you do not edit your Payment Method information or cancel your account, you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts and authorize us to continue billing the Payment Method, as it may be updated. This may result in a change to your payment billing dates. For certain Payment Methods, the issuer of your Payment Method may charge you a foreign transaction fee or other charges. Check with your Payment Method service provider for details.
You may cancel your license at any time, and you will continue to have access to the service through the end of your prepayment period as identified in your Payment Plan.
Classcraft reserves the right to cancel this agreement, or to change your services from a premium subscription to a free Subscription at any time that the payment is for any reason overdue by 15 days or more.
Classcraft reserves the right to offer teachers and parents the opportunity to buy merchandise, both virtual and real.
Note that, by using the Services, you may receive e-mail or text messages on your phone or mobile device, which may cause you to incur usage charges or other fees or costs in accordance with your wireless or data service plan. Furthermore, should you access the game from a mobile device or via the internet you may be subject to data usage charges. Any and all such charges, fees, or costs are your sole responsibility. You should consult with your wireless and/or internet carrier to determine what rates, charges, fees, or costs may apply to your use of the Services.

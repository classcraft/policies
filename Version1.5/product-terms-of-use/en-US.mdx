    2. ### Notice to Users in the United States Regarding COPPA and Parental Consent

        1. Under the United States’ Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), online service providers such as Classcraft must provide parental notification and obtain verifiable parental consent before collecting personal information from children under the age of 13, except in limited situations (for exceptions to this consent requirement, please see [16 CFR § 312.5(c)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/16/312.5)). Except as expressly set forth in Section 4.2.2 below and in our [Website](http://www.classcraft.com/website-privacy-policy) and [Product](https://www.classcraft.com/privacy-policy/) Privacy Policies, Classcraft does not knowingly collect such personally identifiable information from a child under the age of 13.
        2. As outlined in our [Product Privacy Policy](http://www.classcraft.com/privacy-policy) and [Direct Notice to Educational Institutions](https://www.classcraft.com/coppa-direct-notice), Classcraft may collect certain personal information, such as a Student’s first and last name, username, and email address, but only for the benefit of the school in terms of the Student’s participation in using the Services for the Licensed Class and for no other commercial purpose. Classcraft will not collect such personal information from a child under the age of 13 unless that child's Teacher or Teacher’s school or school district have agreed to obtain the required parental consent pursuant to Section 4.2.3 below. If such personal information is collected without parental consent or collected beyond the scope needed for participation in the Services, Classcraft will delete such information as soon as possible. If you believe that information from a student under the age of 13 has been provided in violation of these terms, please contact us at [wecare@classcraft.com](mailto:wecare@classcraft.com).
        3. If you are a Teacher and your school or district has not already obtained parental consent as required under COPPA, you agree to obtain parental consent for online collection of personal information from children under 13 prior to their use of the Services. When obtaining Consent, you must provide Parents with a copy of our [Product Privacy Policy](http://www.classcraft.com/privacy-policy), which explains the types of personal information Classcraft may collect. We also recommend providing Parents with a copy of our [Direct Notice to Educational Institutions](http://classcraft.com/coppa-direct-notice).

            A sample consent form can be found at: [https://help.classcraft.com/hc/en-us/articles/218411437-Classcraft-and-COPP](https://help.classcraft.com/hc/en-us/articles/218411437-Classcraft-and-COPPA).

            You must keep signed Consents on file and provide them to Classcraft upon our request. For more information on COPPA, please see: [https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/privacy-and-security/children%27s-privacy](https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/privacy-and-security/children%27s-privacy).

        4. You acknowledge that Classcraft is not required to obtain consent directly from Parents under COPPA, and that Classcraft can presume that your authorization for the collection of Students’ personal information is based upon you having obtained the Parents’ consent.

5. ## Privacy and Security
    1. You and Classcraft agree to comply with the requirements of all applicable privacy and security laws, including, but not limited to, COPPA, Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), and applicable State laws in the United States; applicable Provincial and Territorial laws in Canada; and the General Data Protection Regulation in the European Union.
    2. You acknowledge and agree that, to the extent necessary to provide the Services and fulfill its duties as outlined in this agreement, Classcraft may receive, collect, and process student Education Records and/or Personally Identifiable Information as a School Official with a legitimate educational interest under FERPA. Classcraft acknowledges and agrees that ownership of such records and/or information will remain with the school, Parent, and/or Student, as applicable.
    3. For information regarding Classcraft’s treatment of Personal Information / Personally Identifiable Information and other user data, please review our [Product](https://www.classcraft.com/privacy-policy/) and [Website](https://www.classcraft.com/website-privacy-policy/) Privacy Policies, which are hereby incorporated into this Agreement by reference.

    2. You release Classcraft from all liability for you having acquired or not acquired Content through the Services.
    3.

    4. The Services are provided on an "AS IS" basis, without warranties of any kind, either express or implied, including, without limitation, implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, or that use of the Services will be uninterrupted or error-free.
10. ## Registration
    1. As a condition to using Services, you will be required to register with Classcraft and select or use a User ID. Further to your representation and warranty in the preamble to the Agreement, you shall provide Classcraft with accurate, complete, and updated registration information. Failure to do so shall constitute a breach of this Agreement, which may result in immediate termination of your account.
    2. You may not (i) select or use as a User ID a name of another person with the intent to impersonate that person; or (ii) use as a User ID a name subject to any rights of a person other than you without appropriate authorization.
    3. Classcraft reserves the right to refuse registration of or cancel a User ID in its discretion. You shall be responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password.
11. ## Fees for Individual Teacher Licenses
    1. Teachers may subscribe to the paid version of Classcraft and in doing so will agree to the fees then in force for access to this version.
    2. Classcraft reserves the right to change its price list for certain Services and to institute new charges at any time, upon notice to you. If you continue to use those Services following such notification, that use constitutes your acceptance of any new or increased charges.
    3. Classcraft will automatically bill your Payment Method each month or year on the calendar day corresponding to the commencement of your paying membership. Membership fees are fully earned upon payment. Classcraft reserves the right to change the timing of this billing, in particular, as indicated below, if your Payment Method has not successfully settled. In the event your paying membership began on a day not contained in a given month, Classcraft may bill your Payment Method on a day in the applicable month or such other day as we deem appropriate. For example, if you started your license on January 31st, your next payment date is likely to be February 28th, and your Payment Method would be billed on that date. Your billing date may change due to changes in your license.
    4. Payments are nonrefundable and there are no refunds or credits for partially used periods. Following any cancellation, however, you will continue to have access to the services through the end of your prepayment period as identified in your Payment Plan. At any time, and for any reason, we may provide a refund, discount, or other consideration to some or all of our members ("credits"). The amount and form of such credits, and the decision to provide them, are at our sole and absolute discretion. The provision of credits in one instance does not entitle you to credits in the future for similar instances, nor does it obligate us to provide credits in the future, under any circumstance.
    5. You may edit your Payment Method information by logging into the game and clicking on the "My Profile" link. If a payment is not successfully settled, due to expiration, insufficient funds, or otherwise, and you do not edit your Payment Method information or cancel your account, you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts and authorize us to continue billing the Payment Method, as it may be updated. This may result in a change to your payment billing dates. For certain Payment Methods, the issuer of your Payment Method may charge you a foreign transaction fee or other charges. Check with your Payment Method service provider for details.
    6. You may cancel your license at any time, and you will continue to have access to the service through the end of your prepayment period as identified in your Payment Plan.

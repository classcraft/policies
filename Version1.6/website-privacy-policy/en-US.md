## Regional Compliance

### European Union

Since May 24, 2018, the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has defined the rules regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information for citizens of the European Union (EU). Classcraft complies with applicable GDPR rules.

In order to operate its services, and in accordance with this Privacy Policy, Classcraft may collect, use, and retain personal information from users of the Classcraft Product who are based in the EU.

Furthermore, in order to operate its services, and in accordance with this Privacy Policy, Classcraft also conducts business with third-party data processors in the United States, where personal information for users of the Classcraft Product is stored. Accordingly, when Classcraft transfers personal information outside of the European Economic Area to the United States, such transfers will be governed by data processing agreements that comply with European Union data protection requirements.

### Quebec

Rights of users located in Quebec are governed by the Act Respecting the Protection of Personal Information in the Private Sector. Individual files can be accessed and modified using your user login and password, or by following the instructions in the section of this document titled “Changes to and Access to Personal Information.” Classcraft offices are at 125 High Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02110. Data is stored on Amazon servers in the United States and Classcraft abides by article 17 of the Act with respect to the use of personal information.

## Security Policy

Classcraft uses industry standard methods to protect the confidentiality, security, and integrity of its customer’s data against unauthorized use or access, disclosure, alteration, unlawful or accidental destruction, or loss. We ensure that all such protected data is encrypted both at rest and in transit, and is only retained or deleted in accordance with this Privacy Policy or any overriding agreements with educational agencies.

Classcraft does not share the data covered by this policy informally among its employees. Only those employees who require the protected data to carry out their duties are granted access. In such cases, access is granted based on the principle of least privilege, which means that each program and employee are granted the fewest privileges necessary to complete their tasks. Employees with access to protected data are given training to apprise them of their responsibilities when handling data and the various laws and agreements covering data security. Such employees are also given a unique user ID for purposes of accountability.

Classcraft performs periodic risk/vulnerability assessments and data privacy and security compliance audits. Classcraft will remediate any identified security vulnerabilities in a timely manner. We also have a written incident response plan, as well as best practices for responding to a breach of personally identifiable information. We will share this incident response plan upon request.

While Classcraft is committed to implementing best practices with regard to information and data security, we cannot make a 100% security guarantee due to constant advances in virus and hacking technology, as well as unforeseeable hardware or software failures and other risk factors. Classcraft can therefore not be held responsible for data loss or alteration. Classcraft will notify any affected user of a security breach via email within 3 days following discovery of the breach.

For additional information about our security measures and Security Policy, please contact us at [wecare@classcraft.com](mailto:wecare@classcraft.com).

## Changes to and Access to Personal Information 

Users may also request a copy of their personal information, or can make modifications to any incorrect information by sending a written request to [wecare@classcraft.com](mailto:wecare@classcraft.com). The following information has to be provided:

-   First and last name;
-   Email; and
-   Phone Number.

The user will then be contacted by a member of the Classcraft team for verification purposes.

Users can also correct and update their personal information using the same procedures described above.

## Change of Control

In the event that all or a portion of Classcraft or its assets are acquired by or merged with a third party, personal information that we have collected from users would be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by that third party. This Privacy Policy will continue to apply to your information, and any acquirer would only be able to handle your personal information as per this policy.

In the unlikely event that Classcraft goes out of business, all user information will be securely deleted within 12 months of the date of going out of business.

## Disclosure of Information to Satisfy Legal Obligations

Classcraft may disclose personal information if we have a good faith belief that doing so is necessary to comply with the law, such as complying with a subpoena or other legal process. We may need to disclose personal information where, in good faith, we think it is necessary to protect the rights, property, or safety of Classcraft, our employees, our community, or others, or to prevent violations of our Terms of Use or other agreements. This includes, without limitation, exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection or responding to government requests.

## Changes and Updates to the Privacy Policy

Should we make modifications to this policy or the related User Agreement we will post the updated Privacy Policy and/or User Agreements on the Website.
